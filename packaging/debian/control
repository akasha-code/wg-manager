Description: Interactive TUI helper for WireGuard VPN server management
 WireGuard Manager is an interactive TUI helper designed to simplify the
 day-to-day management of a self-hosted WireGuard VPN server. It wraps the
 'wg' tooling with an fzf-powered menu so you can configure the server,
 add peers and inspect status without memorizing long commands.
 .
 The project ships with bilingual (EN/ES) prompts, guided first-run wizards
 and sane defaults so that you can go from zero to a usable VPN in minutes.
 .
 Key features:
  * First-run onboarding with multiple setup modes
  * Automatic config management with .env files
  * Peer provisioning with QR codes and routing options
  * Service helpers for WireGuard management
  * Multi-language support (English/Spanish)
  * User-friendly interface with clear navigation
